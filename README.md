#### Note when testing the application
Keep in mind that different servlet implementations support different versions of the Servlet API.
For example list of supported versions for 
Jetty can be found [here](https://eclipse.dev/jetty/)
and Tomcat [here](https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html).
Use whichever Servlet implementation you like.
